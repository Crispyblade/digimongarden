### **Whimsy & Thorne's Field Guide to the Digital World: An Unofficial & Unfiltered Compendium of Its Magnificent Metropolises**

### **Entry 1: Amaterasu City – The Phoenix's Roost and Humanity's Heart**

**By Whimsy the Terriermon & Professor Aris Thorne**

**Professor Thorne:** Welcome, new arrivals to the Digital World, and specifically, to Amaterasu City. As a historian specializing in displaced cultures, I can attest that this city is a remarkable testament to human resilience. It serves as the capital of the Phoenix Kingdom, ruled by Queen Sabrina Flamewing, and truly represents humanity's tenacious spirit. This isn't just a city; it's a living promise—a vow that humanity *will* rise from the ashes and eventually find its way home.

**Whimsy:** *And what a home it is, Professor! So many interesting smells and bright lights! It originally tried to be a big Portal Hub, connecting worlds, but no luck yet. Still, it's super important, and boy, is it ever protected! You'll see big, shiny Knightmon everywhere, clanking around doing their patrols. And two *Royal Knight Digimon*! One of them, LordKnightmon Simon, is the Queen’s partner and *very* serious about his roses! The human guards are... well, they mostly seem busy with paperwork, which Aris says is 'crucial bureaucracy.' I'm just glad the Digimon do the heavy lifting!*

**Professor Thorne:** Indeed, Whimsy. The city's defenses are formidable, with two Royal Knights never straying far from the Queen and a multitude of Knightmon ensuring security. Our human police and guards handle domestic order, allowing the specialized Digimon forces to focus on larger threats. Artistically, Amaterasu City is a fascinating amalgamation. Its architecture blends classical Roman and Greek styles with romantic fantasy, all subtly influenced by Digimon aesthetics. The predominant marble and metal construction gives it an elegant, robust feel. More than that, Amaterasu is unique for its incredible diversity, drawing from various human and Digital World influences—you'll see everything from Japanese and Polish nuances to influences from Orda and Phanthara, making it, architecturally, the most eclectic city in this world.

**Whimsy:** *Some folks from other cities, like Asuka, actually have the nerve to say our cities look similar! Can you believe it? The Amaterasu residents certainly can't, and I've heard some *very* strong opinions on that, usually after a particularly large meal!*

### **The Laws of the Land: A Thorne-y Subject (But Necessary!)**

**Professor Thorne:** Now, an extremely vital point that cannot be overstated: Amaterasu City, and the entire Old Sector, operates under **Human Laws**. This is a stark divergence from the Digimon Council-controlled territories you might encounter elsewhere. Here, **Digimon Council laws DO NOT apply.** I've even compiled a concise list for clarity.

**Whimsy:** *Yeah! It’s like a different rulebook entirely! And no collars here, thank the stars! Professor Aris says it’s all about ‘maintaining societal integrity’ and ‘humanitarian principles,’ but I just think it's because Queen Sabrina is super nice and doesn’t like bullies!*

**Old Sector Rules (As Explained by Professor Thorne, with Whimsy's Commentary):**
1.  **Order and Stability:** Maintaining peace within the city walls is paramount. *No unnecessary chaos, says Aris, even if it might be a little fun sometimes!*
2.  **Human Civilian Protection:** Our highest priority. *Queen Sabrina truly cares!*
3.  **Subdue Aggressors:** Efforts are made to subdue threats, not eliminate immediately. *Unless they're really, really mean!*
4.  **Digimon Level Assessment:** Check a Digimon's power level to gauge danger. *Aris always squints at them with his spectacles!*
5.  **Permit for Leaving the Old Sector:** Humans require a permit to leave. *It's dangerous out there! Trust us, we know!*
6.  **Freelancer Guild Caravan Protection:** Trade caravans are protected. *And these guys are tough, Whimsy hears!*
7.  **Recovery of Enslaved Humans:** Any human found enslaved or kept as a pet by a Digimon will be recovered. *This one's super important, Aris always emphasizes it! Slavery is BAD!*
8.  **Self-Defense Only:** Engage Digimon in combat only for self-defense. *Don't go looking for trouble, little guys!*
9.  **Non-Violent Solutions:** Seek peaceful resolutions where possible. *Talking is sometimes better than brawling, even for a spunky Terriermon!*
10. **Freelancer Guild Respect:** Treat them with respect; they're friends to both species. *They get things done!*
11. **No Weapons in City:** Civilians and travelers cannot carry weapons. *My ears are my weapons, Professor! And my cuteness, of course!*
12. **Digimon Registration:** Digimon entering must register or have a human vouch for them. *Like how Professor Aris vouches for me! Aren’t I the best?*
13. **Slavery Strictly Forbidden:** This is a major crime. *This is the BIGGEST rule here, and the best!*

### **Daily Life in the Digital Dawn: Sustenance and Stalls!**

**Professor Thorne:** Now, Amaterasu City, while structured, offers a variety of livelihoods and amenities. While the city's districts differ greatly, a sense of community generally prevails.

**Whimsy:** *And so much food! My favorite topic! Aris always gets grumpy when I try to describe all the delicious smells in too much detail, but how can you not? There’s Rose Wine, Cow Milk – it’s so creamy! – and *many* kinds of Beer! But not for me! The Chicken Kebabs are fantastic, and French Fries are a solid choice anywhere! Don't even get me started on the Pancakes for breakfast! Mmm, sugar!*

**Professor Thorne:** (Adjusts spectacles) Yes, Whimsy, the local cuisine is indeed varied. From staple grains like Bread and Corn to comforting dishes like Chicken Soup and hearty meats such as Pork and Beef, you will find ample sustenance. Culturally, food preparation here draws from countless traditions.

**Living Arrangements:**
*   **[[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/White District\|White District]]:** This district, aptly named for its white six-story apartment blocks and year-round blossoming white-flowered trees, is modern and clean. It's highly desirable but comes with a high cost of living. Many residents struggle to afford the rent.
*   **[[Slums District\|Slums District]]:** In stark contrast, this is the poorest area, where scavenged materials form many of the dwellings. It's undeniably dirty and unsanitary but surprisingly low in crime, with a strong, interdependent community. It's a harsh existence, but the people look out for one another.

**Finding Your Purpose (Work!):**
*   **[[Admin Offices\|Admin Offices]]:** For those seeking bureaucratic roles or city-managed labor, these central offices handle job placements and salaries. Don't expect charming smiles, but they are efficient.
*   **[[Organizations/Freelancer/Freelancer Guild\|Freelancer Guild]]:** Should you possess a thirst for adventure—or simply need better pay—the Freelancer Guild offers numerous contracts outside the city. Teams require a minimum of three members, including at least one Digimon, to operate beyond the city limits. Be warned: this work is dangerous but rewarding.
*   **General Commerce:** Smaller enterprises abound. The Smitch Shop, run by the Impmon Joevit, offers weapons (though those for far-off travel only) and the Silverino Card Shop, managed by the elderly Mr. Silverino, sells cards, comics, and surprisingly, *power armor maintenance manuals.*
*   **Auction House:** Owned by the astute [[Klaus Hermanos\|Klaus Hermanos]] and his Fangmon partner, Reno, this steampunk-inspired establishment houses the "[[Bald Baron Company\|Bald Baron Company]]," a highly efficient human caravan service. They constantly seek staff for their trade routes across the Old Sector and even into others.

### **Prominent Places: Whimsy's Hot Spots (and Aris's Notes!)**

**Professor Thorne:** As we journey through the Digital World, you'll find that each city possesses a unique character. Amaterasu is no exception, boasting several distinctive landmarks and hubs.

**Whimsy:** *These are my favorites! I’ve tried to poke my nose into every single one! Professor Aris says I have 'no respect for personal space,' but you can't learn without exploring, can you?!*

*   **[[Marble Palace\|Marble Palace]]:** *Ooh, so grand! All white marble, and it smells like roses all the time! That’s where Queen Sabrina lives, and you’ll see lots of Knightmon guarding it. LordKnightmon Simon, 'Mr. Rosy' himself, owns it but gave most to the Queen. His throne room is white and gold, but Aris says it’s 'modest.' I just think it’s pretty!*
*   **Rosewood Park:** *This is Simon's absolute favorite! A giant labyrinth of rose bushes! It's so beautiful, but don't you dare litter or break anything, or 'Mr. Rosy' will be after you!*
*   **Trade District:** *Woah, future-stuff! It's like a whirlwind of lights and signs, and everything smells amazing! So many vending machines, and Professor Aris says the food is 'enchanted with amazing flavors.' The lines are long though!*
*   **Flamewing Inn:** *This place is so cozy! It was Queen Sabrina's old house! Run by a sweet old human lady called Alisa Greenwind, Granny to everyone. She makes the best apple and pear pies! The place is all fiery orange and gold inside!*
*   **Goroto Bar:** *This is in the Slums District, and it's… rustic! Very rustic! It's run by Clissa, a little Shakomon who talks like a pirate! She serves cheap booze and sometimes… *moldy* food. But Aris says it ‘caters to the local demographic’s fiscal constraints.’ I call it ‘character-building cuisine’!*
*   **Pink Club:** *Professor Aris says this is a 'high-end establishment.' It's very fancy, black and pink, for rich folks. Lots of dancing and expensive drinks. *Definitely* not a place for a Terriermon like me to be unsupervised! And there are lots of Black Phoenix Organization guards there.*
*   **Portal Hub:** *This is where the big, sleepy portals are. They used to go to other worlds, but now they're just… waiting. Everyone guards them super carefully, hoping they'll wake up. It’s a very important silent room.*
*   **Royal Airfield:** *The only airport left! It's where the last three airships live: "Freedom Nova," "Glorious Faust," and "Vengeful Dragon." It's so flat and big, sometimes they have festivals here!*
*   **Silverino Card Shop:** *This is an old-fashioned shop run by Mr. Silverino. He sells cards and comics, and even old toys! It's a little sad, because Aris says people don’t have much fun anymore, but Mr. Silverino still keeps it going!*
*   **Smitch Shop:** *Joevit the Impmon runs this! He sells weapons, mostly swords and axes, but also guns—only for *outside* the city, Aris warns! Joevit is funny and likes bubblegum!*
*   **The Gilded Gryphon:** *A fancy restaurant in the White District. It's owned by Basileus, a SaberLeomon, who Professor Aris says is ‘proud to a fault.’ The food is excellent, though!*
*   **Trade District:** *A bustling, futuristic district often compared to modern-day Tokyo. It features numerous vending machines and compact shops that offer a vast array of items. Despite long queues, the food here is renowned for its incredible flavors. The district is a chaotic yet fascinating spectacle of lights and multi-lingual signs.*
*   **White District:** *This is where most humans live! It's clean and modern, lots of white buildings and white flowers. Pretty but expensive, Aris laments.*
*   **Slums District:** *Dirty, chaotic, and smells… unique! But the people here really help each other. Mostly rundown buildings, but Professor Aris says their community spirit is ‘a fascinating anthropological study.’ I just think they’re tough!*
*   **Admin Offices:** *Lots of busy humans here, shuffling papers quietly. Work! That’s what Aris says this place is for. Very organized!*
*   **Auction House:** *Steampunk! That's the word Professor Aris uses! It’s run by Klaus Hermanos and his Fangmon partner, Reno. They also have a caravan company that travels all over!*
*   **Black Phoenix HQ:** *A big, military-looking building on the edge of the city. Lots of robots. Professor Aris says it's where Rudolf Flamewing, the Queen's brother, commands from. It feels very… serious.*
*   **Chrome Factory:** *This place is for building tools and weapons and robotic stuff for defense! Lots of BPO robot guards here.* (No further details from our travels yet!)
*   **Prison:** *Well, nowhere I want to visit, and Professor Aris certainly doesn't either!* (No details from our travels yet!)

### **Beyond the City Walls: The Old Sector – A Land of Ruins and Riches!**

**Professor Thorne:** Beyond the protective walls of Amaterasu City lies the Old Sector. This extensive territory is heavily scarred by past conflicts, a constant reminder of the "Great Divinity." While human law prevails, danger is ever-present.

**Whimsy:** *It looks a bit sad and burnt sometimes, Professor. Like the Scorched Tavi Forest – it's full of burnt trees! But it’s not all bad! There are places like the Riverton City Ruins, which used to be for fun and games! And the Verro Mines are just bursting with shiny ores and gems! That’s where many poorer humans go to work, though it’s still tough, tough work.*

**Professor Thorne:** Indeed, Whimsy. The Old Sector contains vital resources and challenging environments. Key locations include the Amaterasu City itself, Fort Falco Ruins, Rose City Ruins, Riverton City Ruins, Scorched Tavi Forest, Sector Border Outpost, and the Verro Mines. Trade caravans from Amaterasu City, always heavily protected for obvious reasons, regularly venture out to established safe zones in other sectors.

### **Crucial Counsel for New Arrivals (From Your Trusty Guides!)**

**Professor Thorne:** It is imperative you understand these final points. Your safety hinges upon this knowledge.

**Whimsy:** *Listen to Professor Aris! He knows lots!*

*   **The Black Phoenix Organization (BPO):** *They're supposed to help defend the city, but Aris says they're full of 'thuggish humans and unsavory Digimon.' Most folks here don't like working with them much.*
*   **Digimon Council Laws Elsewhere:** *This is the really tricky bit! Here, slavery is a crime. But in sectors controlled by the Digimon Council, humans can be 'pets' or 'slaves' legally! It makes Professor Aris very unhappy, and Queen Sabrina fights against it. So be very, very careful if you ever leave the Old Sector!*
*   **The Other Royal Knight, Cid:** *Oh! And I almost forgot! Besides Simon, there's another super-powerful Royal Knight, Cid the Dynasmon! He’s a big, impressive guy with armor, looks a bit like a blue-skinned knight with wings and talons! He's also a protector of Amaterasu, very noble and polite… but Professor Aris says he’s stuck in a 'complicated contractual obligation.' He has to serve this rich human named Lenny Golfiber from the Black Phoenix Organization. It's really sad, because Cid doesn’t like it, but he has to because of his honor! So, even in a safe place like this, some things are a bit… tangled.*
*   **Your Journey Ahead:** *This Digital World is vast and full of wonders and dangers! But here, in Amaterasu, you have a safe starting point. Whether you want to explore with the Freelancer Guild or settle into city life, there’s a place for you! And maybe, just maybe, you’ll even get a human a Digimon partner like me and Aris! It’s the best!*

**Professor Thorne:** Regardless of your past, you now have an opportunity to forge a new path here. Amaterasu City offers protection, community, and the chance for a future. We extend our warmest welcome.

**Whimsy:** *Stay safe, keep your ears perked, and maybe bring us some snacks for our next entry! Momentai! Err, I mean, let the adventures begin!*
