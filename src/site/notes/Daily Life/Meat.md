Most of the meat in the Digital World comes from non-Digimon animals originally brought from the Human World before the portals were disconnected. These animal populations reproduce at an accelerated rate. A universal accord among Digimon dictates that these animals are to be hunted only for sustenance, not for sport, ensuring the delicacy remains a renewable resource. Common animals include various species of fish, cows, goats, deer, rabbits, and chickens.

While meat farms, primarily located in the Central Sector, produce "Digi-Farm-Meat" daily, it is widely considered less delicious than meat from natural animals.
