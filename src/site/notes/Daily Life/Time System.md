The flow of time in the Digital World is measured in two primary ways.

The official system, established by the [[Organizations/Digimon Council\|Digimon Council]], is the Digital Standard Calendar (DSC). It operates on a system of Rotations (days) and Cycles. A Cycle consists of 300 Rotations. It is viewed by some as a tool of metaphysical control, forcing all official business to be conducted using the Council's measurement of reality.

The more common, colloquial system is a seven-day elemental week. The days are: Aqua-Day (Water), Flora-Day (Plant/Nature), Terra-Day (Earth), Pyro-Day (Fire), Aero-Day (Wind/Sky), Lux-Day (Light), and Umbra-Day (Darkness). On each day, the ambient world energy slightly enhances Digimon and activities of the corresponding element. Umbra-Day is widely considered the most dangerous day, as a lull in the world's data-security field allows Virus-type Digimon and other dark forces to act with greater ease and aggression.

A "human year" is not equivalent to a "cycle." A human year is a biological measurement of aging, which takes approximately 365 rotations. A cycle is a bureaucratic measurement of 300 rotations. The two systems run in parallel but are not interchangeable.
