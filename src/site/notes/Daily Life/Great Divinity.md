The Great Divinity refers to the war between Digimon and humans, which began when a faction of humans attempted to use Digimon Power to conquer both the Human and Digimon Worlds. The war concluded 25 years ago with the victory of the Digimon Council.

The conflict resulted in the near-total destruction of Old Bayakko City, and humans lost control of all territories except for the "Old Sector," which now serves as their designated home. A major aftereffect of the war was the severance of connections to other Digital Worlds and the Human World, trapping the remaining humans. Furthermore, the data instability caused by the war made it nearly impossible for most Digimon to achieve Digivolution on their own.
