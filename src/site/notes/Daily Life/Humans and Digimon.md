- The official currency of the Digital World is **BITS**, which exist as physical gold coins or as digital credits on a data card.
- Captured humans are highly valuable and can be sold for a significant amount of BITS.
- Owning a human is a major status symbol among Digimon, signifying wealth and success.
- If a Digimon's human partner possesses a Digivice, they can facilitate the Digivolution process when the proper conditions are met.
- Some Digimon view humans as a rare and luxurious, albeit forbidden, snack.
- Many Digimon seek to prove their strength by dominating others through various means.
- Though the war is over, relations between humans and Digimon remain deeply fractured and hostile.
- When a Digimon dies, its body dissolves into data. This data travels to a Rebirth Zone, where the Digimon is eventually reborn in a weakened state, often with only fragmented memories of its past life.
- An unusual phenomenon in this Digital World is that many Digimon bodies do not fully dematerialize upon death. While their core data returns to a Rebirth Zone, their physical shells are sometimes left behind.
- Digimon can create new life by providing a portion of their **DDNA** (Digimon DNA). This process creates a new Digimon but severely weakens the donor, as a significant portion of their own Digi-Core's power is transferred in the process.
