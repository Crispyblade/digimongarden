The legal framework established by the Digimon Council governs all Digimon-controlled sectors. Violations typically result in fines or a criminal warrant.

**General Laws**

- Attacking another Digimon within city limits is forbidden, unless a permit has been issued by the Council or the Freelancer Guild for a specific target.
- Fights to the death between Digimon are permitted outside of city limits.

**Laws Concerning Humans**

- Unregistered humans are forbidden from roaming freely and are to be captured on sight.
- All humans must be registered with their sector's Council Member under one of the following classifications: pet, slave, food, or product.
- Owned humans are required to wear a collar at all times. Any human found without a collar may be claimed by any Digimon.
- Slaves possess no rights and are forced to obey their owners. A Digimon's only obligation is to keep them adequately fed and alive.
- The Digimon Council encourages Digimon to assert authority over their human pets and slaves.
- Human pets and slaves are required to obey their Digimon owner and assist them in gaining strength whenever possible.
- The treatment of a human pet is entirely at the discretion of its Digimon owner.
- A human pet cannot hold a job without explicit permission from their owner.
- Slaves are prohibited from owning a Digivice.
- Humans may only register as members of the Freelancer Guild if their team includes at least one Digimon member.
- Designated Neutral Zones offer sanctuary, protecting humans from capture, regardless of whether they wear a collar.
