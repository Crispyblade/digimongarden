The Cycle of Digital Rebirth
In the Digital World, death is rarely permanent for a Digimon. When a Digimon perishes, its Digi-Core – the essence of its life force – shatters into Digital Data. This data is temporarily visible and vulnerable, a swirling mass containing the Digimon's skills, memories, and very being. Unless this data is absorbed or destroyed, it will travel to the nearest Rebirth Point to initiate the rebirth process.

At a Rebirth Point, the scattered Digital Data reforms into a new Digi-Core, which then encapsulates itself within a Digi-Egg. From this egg, the Digimon is reborn in its Fresh or In-Training form, a weak infant beginning anew.

Memory and Identity After Rebirth
Reborn Digimon often retain some, most, or even all of their memories from their previous life. However, certain factors can influence memory recovery:

Partial or No Memory Regain: Sometimes, memories return slowly over time, or not at all. A Digimon might start a new life as a clean slate, essentially a "new person" without recollection of their past.
Species Change: There is always a possibility that a reborn Digimon will not reappear as the same species they were before, adding an element of unpredictability to the process.
Loss of Power: While rebirth offers a second chance, it often comes at the cost of a Digimon's accumulated power, as they return to their weakest form.
Many Digimon are aware that true death is rare, yet the uncertainty of the rebirth process – the potential loss of power, memories, or even species – makes some hesitant to risk it.

Permanent Death
True, permanent death for a Digimon occurs only if its vulnerable Digital Data is absorbed by another Digimon or destroyed before it can reach a Rebirth Point. Other Digimon can intentionally absorb the data of a fallen comrade or foe to gain strength, effectively eliminating the possibility of their revival.

Rebirth Points: Designated Havens
When a Digimon's data is released into the world, if not intercepted, it will gravitate towards established Rebirth Points. These are secure locations specifically designed to facilitate the reformation of Digital Data into a new Digi-Core and the emergence of a Digi-Egg. If no designated Rebirth Point is nearby, the data may reform in a random location, appearing as an egg wherever the data streams converge.

Known locations of established Digi-Egg Rebirth Points include:

Suzaku Temple (South Sector): This temple, affiliated with the Renren Clan, serves as a traditional Rebirth Point.
Mirage Tower (West Sector): A safe haven in the desert, protected by the Mummymon "Mirage Phantom." Reborn Digimon eggs appear beneath the tower itself.
Soft Paw House (Central Sector): A highly regulated, Council-aligned daycare within Asuka City's Human Preservation District. It has strict custody protocols for claiming eggs.
Soft Paw House: Regulated Rebirth
Located within Asuka City's Human Preservation District, Soft Paw House functions as a secure daycare for Fresh and In-Training Digimon, as well as a monitored Rebirth Point. Managed by caretakers like Raymond the Angemon, Clover the Wormmon, and Crypto the Monzaemon, this reinforced dome is filled with toys, eggs, and a safe play area.

Soft Paw House is a highly regulated, Council-aligned facility with strict custody protocols for newly hatched or reborn Digimon. To claim a Digi-Egg, legal ownership/partnership must be established, or direct vouching from senior caretakers is required.

Mirage Tower: A Neutral Oasis
Nestled in the desert, Mirage Tower serves as a neutral zone, primarily colonized by humans. Its protector, a Mummymon known as "Mirage Phantom," maintains its status as a haven where bounty hunters are generally unwelcome. Navigating the ever-shifting sands to reach the tower requires specialized knowledge of a puzzle maze.

Enclosed by fences, the tower itself is a magical, colorful structure with abundant soft sand inside. A settlement of tents, housing both humans and a few Digimon, surrounds it. Inside the Tower, an Inn and Bar with a music stage offer respite. Retrieval of a reborn Digi-Egg found beneath the tower is contingent upon the "Mirage Phantom's" disposition towards the claimant.

Unsorted Points: Risky Rebirths
Not all rebirths occur in controlled environments. Unsorted Points are uncontrolled and unmonitored locations, often the result of data stream collapse or abandoned terrain where old rebirth beacons inadvertently activate.

Digi-Eggs appearing at Unsorted Points are entirely exposed to predators, dangerous conditions, and opportunists. Newborns from these volatile locations rarely develop solid memory data due to the immediate threats they face, making them essentially a "clean slate" if they survive. They are inherently dangerous and unpredictable, and while dismantling them might seem like a service to the Digital World, incorrect intervention could destabilize an entire region.
