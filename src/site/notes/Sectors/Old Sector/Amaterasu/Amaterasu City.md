### **Amaterasu City**

Amaterasu City stands as the sole bastion of uncompromised human control. It is the capital of the [[Phoenix Kingdom\|Phoenix Kingdom]], a realm formed after the "Great Divinity" and ruled by Acting Queen [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/Sabrina Flamewing\|Sabrina Flamewing]]. The city is a marvel of resilience and a testament to Sabrina's promise that humanity will "rise from the ashes and return home once more." Its name honors the Phoenix, a beloved pet from Sabrina's own world.

Originally, the [[Organizations/Black Phoenix Organization\|Black Phoenix Organization]] and the [[Phoenix Kingdom\|Phoenix Kingdom]] were intertwined, but they have since separated into distinct entities. Amaterasu City, located within the [[Sectors/Old Sector/Old Sector\|Old Sector]], is now where the remnants of humanity reside. Some say that [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/Amaterasu City\|Amaterasu City]] and [[Sectors/Central Sector/Asuka City\|Asuka City]] are sister cities due to their similar architecture, a comparison that often irritates Amaterasu residents.

**Architectural Identity**  
Amaterasu City's architecture is a captivating blend of Roman and Greek styles, infused with romantic fantasy elements and subtle hints of the Digimon world. The city is predominantly constructed from marble and metal, offering a robust and elegant aesthetic. Its cityscape is a unique fusion of magic, technology, and creativity, blending traditional designs from various human cultures (such as Japanese, Polish, and others) with the chaotic nature of Digimon architecture. This makes it the most genuinely diverse city in the Digital World. Despite its urban nature, greenery abounds, with numerous trees, flower beds, and rose bushes adorning the roads.

**Defense and Security**  
The city boasts formidable defenses, protected by an army of [[Knightmon\|Knightmon]] and two [[Royal Knight Digimon\|Royal Knight Digimon]]. One Royal Knight is always in close proximity to Queen [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/Sabrina Flamewing\|Sabrina Flamewing]]. Human guards and police officers also contribute to order, though their roles are primarily administrative. The [[Organizations/Black Phoenix Organization\|Black Phoenix Organization]] also acts as a defender of the city, though their thuggish reputation makes many citizens reluctant to work with them.

**Governance and Laws**  
The city operates under its own distinct set of human laws, designed to protect human life and maintain order.

2. Protect human civilians at all costs.

12. Digimon entering the sector must register with the [[Organizations/Freelancer/Freelancer Guild\|Freelancer Guild]] or have a human vouch for them with their life.
