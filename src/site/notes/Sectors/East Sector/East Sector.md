**Overview**  
The [[Sectors/East Sector/East Sector\|East Sector]] is a vast, open, and primarily flat region, characterized by expansive prairies, rolling hills, and dramatic cliffs that mark its borders. It serves as the Digital World's crucial energy hub, blanketed with countless windmills and vast arrays of solar panels that harness the relentless winds and abundant sunlight. While often perceived as empty or monotonous, this sector is the main source of income for its own inhabitants and provides essential power to many of the other sectors. Its landscape, though stark, holds areas of profound, ancient danger and unique natural phenomena.

**Governance & Control**  
The [[Sectors/East Sector/East Sector\|East Sector]] is ruled by [[People/East/Gru\|Gru]] the Metalgarurumon, a fiercely ambitious, vengeful, and aggressively anti-human member of the [[Organizations/Digimon Council\|Digimon Council]]. [[People/East/Gru\|Gru]]'s primary goal is to transform the [[Sectors/East Sector/East Sector\|East Sector]] into a true powerhouse. While he is generally intolerant of humans, he is forced to allow some to reside in his city, primarily due to political leverage exerted by influential Digimon within his territory. He is currently working to unite the dangerous [[Sectors/East Sector/Tyrano Valley\|Tyrano Valley]] under his control, a difficult task given that many Digimon there still resent him for defeating their former leader, [[MasterTyranomon\|MasterTyranomon]].
