Its exact location remains a profound mystery, hidden deep within the treacherous [[Sectors/East Sector/Tyrano Valley\|Tyrano Valley]]. Rumors suggest it could be concealed within a vast cave system, echoing with ancient power, or perched atop one of the valley's highest, most inaccessible peaks, looking out over the fiery landscape.
