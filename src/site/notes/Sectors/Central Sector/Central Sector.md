**Overview**  
The [[Sectors/Central Sector/Central Sector\|Central Sector]] stands as the agricultural and commercial heart of the Digital World. It is a lush, green landscape dominated by vast, high-tech farms that efficiently produce the bulk of the food supply for all other sectors.

**Geography & Industry**  
The region is characterized by extensive grasslands, small forests, and sprawling agricultural land. The sector's wealth and primary export is food. Its three main types of farms include:

- **[[Sectors/Central Sector/Wheat Farms\|Wheat Farms]]** & **[[Corn Farms\|Corn Farms]]**: Dedicated to growing staple crops that feed much of the Digital World.
- **[[Meat Farms\|Meat Farms]]**: A unique and advanced operation utilizing Digimon technology to synthesize various types of meat (such as lamb, beef, and chicken) without the need to harm any living creatures. These farms operate efficiently, requiring only sun, water, and electricity to produce vast quantities of high-quality meat.

**Governance & Defense**  
The [[Sectors/Central Sector/Central Sector\|Central Sector]] has no formal standing army. Instead, every Digimon is obligated to answer the summon of the Council Member, [[People/Central/Ebon\|Ebon]] the [[BlackWarGreymon\|BlackWarGreymon]], in times of crisis. A loose guard force acts as local police, handling minor infractions. Primary peacekeeping duties and road patrols are largely outsourced to the [[Organizations/Freelancer/Freelancer Guild\|Freelancer Guild]]. Major threats are typically handled personally by [[People/Central/Ebon\|Ebon]] and a select group of powerful Digimon he deems worthy.
