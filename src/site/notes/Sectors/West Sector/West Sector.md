**Overview**  
The [[Sectors/West Sector/West Sector\|West Sector]] is the largest and arguably most desolate region of the Digital World, dominated by vast, scorching deserts and rugged badlands. Despite its harsh environment, it is a crucial sector with surprising pockets of life and advanced infrastructure, most notably the bustling [[Sectors/West Sector/New Bayakko City\|New Bayakko City]]. The sector bears the deepest scars of the [[Daily Life/The Great Divinity\|Daily Life/The Great Divinity]] war, with much of its land still in ruins.

**Governance & Control**  
The [[Sectors/West Sector/West Sector\|West Sector]] is controlled by [[People/West/Vancure\|Vancure]] the [[Seraphimon\|Seraphimon]], one of the five [[Organizations/Digimon Council\|Digimon Council]] members. His rule is often characterized by hypocrisy and an egoistical, dismissive attitude, particularly towards humans, whom he views as remnants of a failed past. Despite his angelic appearance, he is often seen as more focused on maintaining his own status than on the welfare of his sector. While he officially enforces the [[Organizations/Digimon Council\|Digimon Council]]'s laws regarding humans, his primary concern is avoiding direct conflict or widespread discontent.

- [[Dumdum Factory\|Dumdum Factory]] A heavily fortified, defunct pre-war factory rumored to be a clandestine meeting point or base for various outlaw Digimon factions and disgruntled human elements.

It protects [[Sectors/West Sector/New Bayakko City\|New Bayakko City]] but poses a deadly challenge to travelers.
- **[[Dactos Juice\|Dactos Juice]]**: A notorious beverage made from dried berries, dactyls, and cactus juice.
