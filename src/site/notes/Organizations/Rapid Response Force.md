The [[Organizations/Rapid Response Force\|Rapid Response Force]] is the primary defensive and peacekeeping organization of the [[Sectors/North Sector/North Sector\|North Sector]], funded primarily by [[People/North/Genbu/Blazer\|Blazer]]. In times of peace, the RRF functions as a police and rescue force, venturing outside [[Sectors/North Sector/Genbu City\|Genbu City]] to assist during disasters or emergency calls. During serious conflicts, it operates as a full-fledged army.

The RRF is a highly organized, well-trained, and equipped with the best gear for arctic travel. All members are required to learn first aid and undergo extensive training before being accepted as full members. While smaller than other sector armies due to its high standards, it is prepared for any contingency. The RRF is an integrated force, accepting both Digimon and Humans into its ranks and operating in mixed squads.

**Headquarters:** The main HQ is the [[Sectors/North Sector/Rapid Response Force Station\|Rapid Response Force Station]] in [[Sectors/North Sector/Genbu City\|Genbu City]].

#### **RRF Threat Assessment Protocol - Manual RRF-7 (Abridged Field Guide)**

**AUTHORIZED EYES ONLY**

**SECTION 1: Classification Framework**  
All hostile entities, phenomena, or events (hereafter "Threats") are classified using a two-tier system: Threat Class (nature and scale of threat) and Operational Level (nature and scale of response). Misclassification is a court-martial offense. Do not guess. Do not assume. Escalate.

**SECTION 2: Threat Classes (Abridged List)**

- **CLASS-WRENCH (Physical - Contained):** Non-sentient physical threat. Examples include malfunctioning machinery, feral Digimon below Champion level, or localized environmental hazards.
    - **Response:** Standard Pacification/Maintenance Unit.
- **CLASS-RAMPART (Physical - Defensive):** Large-scale physical threat requiring strategic containment. Examples include Mega-level Digimon rampages, structural collapse of critical infrastructure, or organized hostile incursions.
    - **Response:** Sector-wide alert. Deployment of multiple RRF divisions.
- **CLASS-JAVELIN (Informational - Intrusive):** Standard data breach. Examples include logic bombs, network viruses, or espionage programs. The threat is confined to data systems.
    - **Response:** RRF Cyber-Warfare Division. Isolate and purge.
- **CLASS-CRUSADER (Ontological - Unquantified):** Entity with suspected reality-altering, memetic, or spatio-temporal capabilities. Power level and vectors are unknown. This is an assessment class, not a combat class.
    - **Response:** **DO NOT ENGAGE**. Establish a quarantine perimeter. Enforce an information blackout. Deploy Sentinel-class scout units for observation **ONLY**. Await reclassification.
- **CLASS-GLADIUS (Ontological - Confirmed):** Entity with confirmed reality-altering capabilities. The threat vector has been identified.
    - **Response:** Highest alert level. Engagement only by designated Primary Countermeasure Assets under direct command of RRF High Council. Prepare for acceptable civilian and structural losses.

**SECTION 3: Operational Levels (Selected)**

- **LEVEL-PATROL:** Standard operations. Examples include reconnaissance, peacekeeping, and civilian assistance.
- **LEVEL-QUARANTINE:** Containment of a known threat. No entry or exit from the designated zone. The focus is on limiting spread, not elimination.
- **LEVEL-REAPER:** Black-level operation with a reality-altering objective. Aims to fundamentally change a core law of physics, time, or existence. Authorization requires a unanimous vote from RRF High Council and the Sector Lord. The failure state assumes total loss of the operational sector or cessation of reality as we know it.
    - **NOTE:** The existence of any Level-Reaper operation is highly classified. Acknowledging this classification outside of need-to-know parameters is considered treason.
