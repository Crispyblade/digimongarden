The [[Organizations/Black Phoenix Organization\|Black Phoenix Organization]] originated as a human defense group under the leadership of the [[Flamewing\|Flamewing]] siblings, [[Sabrina\|Sabrina]] and [[Rudolf\|Rudolf]]. Their headquarters is located in [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/Amaterasu City\|Amaterasu City]]. The BPO utilizes advanced robots and power armor to compensate for their limited numbers and strength. While Digimon are permitted to join, they must be fully aware of the organization's ethos. Over time, the BPO has fractured into two distinct factions:

- **Passive Faction:** Led by Queen [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/Sabrina Flamewing\|Sabrina Flamewing]], this faction focuses on restoring the [[Portal Hub\|Portal Hub]] connection to the human world, helping humanity return home, and ensuring the safety of those under her protection.
- **Aggressive Faction:** Under [[Rudolf Flamewing\|Rudolf Flamewing]], this faction is driven by a desire for revenge against the [[Organizations/Digimon Council\|Digimon Council]]. Their aim is to gain control of the Digital World, weaken their enemies through any available means, and sow chaos.
