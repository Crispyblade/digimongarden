**Headquarters:** [[Ono Residence\|Ono Residence]], [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/Amaterasu City\|Amaterasu City]]  
**Founded:** Approximately 60 years ago by [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/The Onos/Haruki Ono\|Haruki Ono]], a samurai from Japan's Azuchi–Momoyama period, who was transported to the Digital World.  
**Current Patriarch:** [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/The Onos/Haruki Ono\|Haruki Ono]]  
**Primary Influence:** [[Organizations/House Ono\|House Ono]] controls roughly **70% of all agricultural production** in the [[Sectors/Old Sector/Old Sector\|Old Sector]], making them one of the wealthiest and most politically powerful families.  
**Loyalty:** Strongly aligned with [[Rudolf Flamewing\|Rudolf Flamewing]] and the aggressive faction of the [[Organizations/Black Phoenix Organization\|Black Phoenix Organization]]. They are bitter opponents of Queen [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/Sabrina Flamewing\|Sabrina Flamewing]] and her loyalists.

**Members of House Ono**

- **[[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/The Onos/Haruki Ono\|Haruki Ono]]**: Patriarch; no Digimon partner.
- **[[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/The Onos/Isamu Ono\|Isamu Ono]]**: Eldest son; partnered with [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/The Onos/Aurka\|Aurka]] the Magnadramon.

- **[[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/The Onos/Akane Ono\|Akane Ono]]**: Only daughter; no Digimon partner; frequently travels away from the estate.

The Ono children are all of age but remain unmarried due to Haruki's strict traditional views. Haruki forbids marriage to anyone who is not of “pure noble blood” and aligned with his ideology, leading to an ongoing heir crisis within the family.

**Servants of House Ono**

- [[Umino\|Umino]] (Gomamon) The elderly, diligent butler of [[Organizations/House Ono\|House Ono]], known for his unwavering respect for tradition and a surprisingly dry wit. He has a nephew, [[Pip\|Pip]] who also serves in the household.
- [[Pip\|Pip]] (Patamon) A cheerful and often flustered Patamon, eager to please and assist [[Umino\|Umino]]. He handles various household errands with boundless, if sometimes clumsy, energy.
- [[Roku\|Roku]] (Gotsumon) A silent, stoic butler with an impossibly calm demeanor. He moves with heavy efficiency, managing domestic logistics for [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/The Onos/Isamu Ono\|Isamu Ono]] and remaining impassive amidst any chaos within the [[Ono Residence\|Ono Residence]].

**The Ono Residence**

- **Location:** [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/Amaterasu City\|Amaterasu City]], [[Sectors/Old Sector/Old Sector\|Old Sector]]
- **Style:** A meticulously maintained feudal Japanese estate, featuring a small palace structure, expansive open courtyards, and traditional gardens. It deliberately lacks any futuristic technology, adhering strictly to [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/The Onos/Haruki Ono\|Haruki Ono]]'s vision.
- **Security:** Patrols are conducted by human guards trained in classical swordsmanship, following the samurai way. A small contingent of Ninjamon are permitted as additional guards at [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/People/Royalty/The Onos/Haruki Ono\|Haruki Ono]]’s command.
- **Symbol:** The **Ono family necklace** — a chain of golden coins, each stamped with the face of a family member. Those exiled from the family are permanently removed from the chain.

**Tradition Code of [[Organizations/House Ono\|House Ono]]**

1. **Marriage:** Permitted only to individuals of pure noble blood and identical ideology as the Ono Family.
2. **Exile of Traitors:** Those who shame the family will be exiled and branded with a permanent seal of shame on the back of the neck.
3. **Adherence to Tradition:** The family's strength is directly tied to its adherence to traditions. Failure to follow them renders the family valueless.
4. **Mandatory Education:** All heirs must receive education in politics, etiquette, Japanese culture, and the arts of war.
