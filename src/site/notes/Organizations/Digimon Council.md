The [[Organizations/Digimon Council\|Digimon Council]] serves as the supreme governing body of this Digital World, comprised of the five most powerful Digimon, each presiding over their respective sector. Leadership within the Council is determined and maintained solely by strength; positions can be legally challenged and seized through combat.

**Council Members & Their Sectors**

**1. [[People/Central/Ebon\|Ebon]] (BlackWarGreymon) - Ruler of [[Sectors/Central Sector/Central Sector\|Central Sector]]**

- **Public Profile:** Ebon is widely recognized as the powerful and highly disciplined Mega-level BlackWarGreymon who governs the Central Sector from Asuka City. He is known for his strict enforcement of Digimon Council laws and his authoritarian rule. Publicly, Ebon champions order and strength within the Digital World.
- **Common Perception:** He harbors a deep, well-known prejudice against humans, openly blaming them for the "Great Divinity" war and advocating for their subjugation under Digimon authority. He views human registration, collars, and "pet" status as necessary measures for control and stability. His immense power and unwavering stance make him a formidable, if often feared, leader.

**2. [[People/West/Vancure\|Vancure]] (Seraphimon) - Ruler of [[Sectors/West Sector/West Sector\|West Sector]]**

- **Public Profile:** Vancure is the angelic Mega-level Seraphimon who presides over the West Sector, operating from the Azure Tower in New Bayakko City. He presents himself as a wise and authoritative leader, maintaining his position through careful political maneuvering.
- **Common Perception:** Despite his holy appearance, Vancure is largely seen by the public and even his own advisors as an egotistical, hypocritical, and somewhat cowardly ruler. He often dismisses human concerns, viewing them as relics of a failed past, and is known for pushing problems onto other sectors rather than dealing with them directly. His stinginess with resources and his patronizing attitude are frequent sources of public discontent.

**3. [[People/North/Genbu/Blazer\|Blazer]] (Machinedramon) - Ruler of [[Sectors/North Sector/North Sector\|North Sector]]**

- **Public Profile:** Blazer, the colossal Mega-level Machinedramon, is the revered ruler of the North Sector, based in Genbu Fortress. He is publicly known as a protector of his people, both Digimon and Human, and takes immense pride in the harmony of Genbu City.
- **Common Perception:** Widely regarded as the most honorable, fair, and progressive of all the Council members, Blazer actively supports genuine human-Digimon cooperation. He vehemently opposes slavery and any degrading laws against humans, ensuring freedom for all residents in his territory (though a registered Digimon partner is required). He is known for his bravery, compassion, and farsighted vision, believing in a unified future against greater threats. He has earned the flattering nickname "Gigachad" among the public.

**4. [[People/East/Gru\|Gru]] (MetalGarurumon) - Ruler of [[Sectors/East Sector/East Sector\|East Sector]]**

- **Public Profile:** Gru is the MetalGarurumon who rules the East Sector from Syriou City. He is a recognized Council member, dedicated to transforming his sector into a powerhouse despite its size.
- **Common Perception:** Gru is largely perceived as an ambitious, vengeful, and aggressively anti-human ruler. His ruthless past, including the elimination of MasterTyrannomon, has earned him the animosity of many Digimon in Tyrano Valley. While his general policy is harsh towards humans, he is known to make pragmatic exceptions, such as tolerating the presence of a human in Syriou City due to blackmail from the influential Renamon sisters and their bakery, which is a major tourist draw. He is seen as a cunning politician who will bend his own rules when it serves his greater ambitions.

**5. [[Zabazu\|Zabazu]] (Zanbamon) - Ruler of South Sector**

- **Public Profile:** Zabazu is the imposing Mega-level Zanbamon, a warlord who rules the South Sector from Suzaku City. He is a formidable figure, typically seen attached to his horse-like mount.
- **Common Perception:** Zabazu is universally feared and disliked as a cruel, greedy, and purely power-hungry ruler. He has made Digimon slavery legal within his territory and governs through intimidation and force. His aggressive tactics and expansionist desires are openly known, especially his ongoing conflicts with the Renren Clan over their lands and the Suzaku Temple. He is rumored to have a peculiar weakness: a strong aversion to smelly herbs, which can apparently deter him.

**Council Stance on Humans & External Organizations**  
The Council universally views human partners as a sign of weakness for those at their level of power, or at best, as a useful tool for lesser Digimon. They tolerate human-involved organizations strictly for pragmatic reasons:

- The [[Organizations/Freelancer/Freelancer Guild\|Freelancer Guild]] is a sanctioned, mixed-species group utilized to handle low-priority tasks, allowing the Council to keep powerful independent agents under surveillance.
- The [[Organizations/Rapid Response Force\|Rapid Response Force]] is a necessary exception, permitted to operate in the harsh [[Sectors/North Sector/North Sector\|North Sector]] because it effectively defends a vital buffer zone that the Council deems too inefficient to manage directly.

**Key Historical Context**  
The [[Daily Life/The Great Divinity\|Daily Life/The Great Divinity]] was a catastrophic war initiated by humans, leading to their subsequent decline. This historical event is the root cause of many Digimon's deep-seated prejudice and distrust toward humanity.
