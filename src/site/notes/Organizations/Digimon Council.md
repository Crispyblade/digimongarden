The [[Organizations/Digimon Council\|Digimon Council]] serves as the supreme governing body of this Digital World, comprised of the five most powerful Digimon, each presiding over their respective sector. Leadership within the Council is determined and maintained solely by strength; positions can be legally challenged and seized through combat.

**Council Members & Their Sectors**

- **[[People/Central/Ebon\|Ebon]]** (BlackWarGreymon), [[Sectors/Central Sector/Central Sector\|Central Sector]]: An authoritarian and highly disciplined ruler who harbors a deep prejudice against humans, blaming them for the [[Daily Life/Great Divinity\|Great Divinity]] war and advocating for their subjugation.
- **[[People/West/Vancure\|Vancure]]** (Seraphimon), [[Sectors/West Sector/West Sector\|West Sector]]: An often hypocritical and egotistical leader who dismisses humans as mere relics of a failed past.
- **[[People/North/Genbu/Blazer\|Blazer]]** (Machinedramon), [[Sectors/North Sector/North Sector\|North Sector]]: The most honorable, fair, and progressive of the Council members. He actively supports human-Digimon cooperation and staunchly opposes slavery.
- **[[People/East/Gru\|Gru]]** (MetalGarurumon), [[Sectors/East Sector/East Sector\|East Sector]]: An ambitious, vengeful, and aggressively anti-human ruler, though he is sometimes forced to tolerate humans due to complex political pressures.
- **[[Zabazu\|Zabazu]]** (Zanbamon), [[Sectors/South Sector/South Sector\|South Sector]]: A cruel and greedy warlord who has legalized Digimon slavery within his territory and governs through fear and intimidation.

**Council Stance on Humans & External Organizations**  
The Council universally views human partners as a sign of weakness for those at their level of power, or at best, as a useful tool for lesser Digimon. They tolerate human-involved organizations strictly for pragmatic reasons:

- The [[Organizations/Freelancer/Freelancer Guild\|Freelancer Guild]] is a sanctioned, mixed-species group utilized to handle low-priority tasks, allowing the Council to keep powerful independent agents under surveillance.
- The [[Organizations/Rapid Response Force\|Rapid Response Force]] is a necessary exception, permitted to operate in the harsh [[Sectors/North Sector/North Sector\|North Sector]] because it effectively defends a vital buffer zone that the Council deems too inefficient to manage directly.

**Key Historical Context**  
The [[Daily Life/Great Divinity\|Great Divinity]] was a catastrophic war initiated by humans, leading to their subsequent decline. This historical event is the root cause of many Digimon's deep-seated prejudice and distrust toward humanity.
