FILE ID: C-7734 | PROJECT CHIMERA - OPERATIONAL DOSSIER

**SECURITY CLEARANCE:** EYES ONLY - OPERATIVE '[[People/North/Genbu/Clawia\|Clawia]]' & ASSET '[[People/Misc/Andrew\|Andrew]]'
**LAST UPDATED:** ROT.15 | CYC.27
**STATUS:** ACTIVE | PHASE 4 (REASSESSMENT & ALTERNATE PATHWAYS)

---

### **PRIMARY ASSET: ANDREW ('CONSULTANT')**

*   **Designation:** Unregistered Human Male
*   **Age:** Approx. 26 Human years (~15 years at time of separation from 'HOLY'). **UPDATE:** Cognitive deep-dive with entity 'AURKA' confirms asset experienced approx. 10 years of aging and intensive survival training with operative '[[People/Misc/Holy\|Holy]]'.
*   **Physical:** 6'3", 100kg. High physical resilience (Strength Units: 200, equivalent to a low-level Champion). Asset is terrified of this strength and actively uses limiters (swordsmanship, restraint codes) to avoid relying on it.
Hovia's Note: Yeah I would've been upset if he revealed that to me too early, so not a bad idea to hide it
*   **Known Abilities:**
    *   **[ABILITY: REVIVAL]:** Asset possesses ability to self-resurrect post-termination. Process and timeline are unknown. Highest-level strategic asset. He views his own death as a tactical inconvenience rather than a true failure.
- Andrew's Note: I sure don't! It sucks!
    *   **[ABILITY: TELEPORTATION]:** Instantaneous, untraceable spatial relocation. Range appears significant (inter-sector). Prone to impulsive use, creating severe security breaches. *(See Incident Log: GULI-01)*. Asset maintains a network of secret teleport beacons/apartments.
Andrew's Note: Hey I've been reducing said impulsivity!
    *   **[ABILITY: EMPATHIC ANALYSIS]:** Asset demonstrates an unnerving, passive ability to identify psychological vulnerabilities and core motivations in others ("ontological warfare"). This is his primary engagement method. *(Note: This includes myself Clawia. Requires further analysis and potential counter-measure development.)*
-Hovia's Note: Just say he gives good hugs and can break an emotionally distant digimon with a hug Claws
    *   **[ABILITY: THE SOVEREIGN'S MANTLE]:** A coat woven from the fur of the Magnadramon, Aurka. Projects a passive aura of Sovereign-class authority that acts as a potent deterrent against the 'Logic-Eater' anomaly and its derivatives (e.g., 'Nightingale'). This is our primary weapon and shield against the Entity. Additionally was used to heavily damage Blacklaw the devimon

### **PRIMARY MISSION OBJECTIVE**

1.  **[COMPLETE - PENDING REVIEW] Support asset 'HOLY' and Neutralize the 'LOGIC-EATER' Anomaly:** Nightingale entity neutralized. Primary operative 'HOLY' has been re-integrated and is now operating independently to pursue leads on 'Doctor Renard' as well as assist on stealth operations, re: Arresting of former RRF quartermaster Kotomon Lee.
2.  **[FAILED - REASSESSING] Execute 'PROJECT CHIMERA' via Digivice Link:** The initial plan to formalize the partnership bond via the Digivice has resulted in catastrophic failure. The Digivice itself is inert. The core concept of a direct data-link is too unstable. New pathways must be explored.
3.  **[COMPLETE - PENDING NEW INFORMATION] Investigate the 'Snow Renamon':** Its connection to Andrew's past remains under investigation with RRF operative Clawia. Connection about past seems to have been incorrect as agent Holy was found without her help.
4. **[COMPLETE] Investigate the Renren clan]** After asset had unscheduled contact with Noboro the Huntmaster operation Polite Inquiry was launched. After a month under house arrest. Asset left with the approval of the clan matron Furella.
- Hovia's note: And almost got him killed permanently via those trials. Bitch

5. **[COMPLETE - UNDERWAY]** Asset believed own capabilities to be insufficient for damaging highly armored digimon, such as asset Hovia's Grizzlymon form. Beseached the Renren clan for training in this regards. Asset has in a short span of a week gained novice level power with elemental magic. Currently strengthening said magic.
- Hovia's note: Still a cheating bastard though
- Andrew's note: Yeah yeah fatty still can't beat you, yet~
- Addendum: Asset 'Andrew' has successfully defeated asset 'Hovia' in a sparring match. Asset 'Andrew' was also able to defeat assets 'Hovia' and 'Clawia' simultaneously in their rookie forms. Shows remarkable growth

### **PROJECT CHIMERA POTENTIAL CANDIDATES**
-Clawia's Note: This was added at the request of asset Andrew

* **CLUTCHES THE SNOW RENAMON**
- Andrew's Note: HIGHLY dependent on future interactions. We share a common enemy with the BPO was the intention. Also she's doing a lot better mentally after we let her gut the Pink Bitch

* **Rollo the Armidallomon**
- Clawia's Note: ... Andrew he's weak and almost as bad as Cheertrick
- Andrew's Note: He's cute, sweet, and loyal! Even if he's... a bit lazy

* **Hazerub the Dorumon**
- Andrew's Note: Also a cute little guy. Has a defined goal (becoming strong and well known enough to make his species famous). Knows how to move fast in the sectors, and overall, a surprisingly nice guy.

* **Lizliz the Meicoomon**
- Andrew's note: Everyone so far seems to be fine with her, Holy has met her as well and she seemed to like her
