# Welcome to the Digital World!

Hello, Tamers and Freelancers!

Welcome to our shared notes for our adventures in a world of digital monsters. Twenty-five years have passed since the end of the **Great Divinity**, a devastating war that shattered the connections between worlds and left humans and Digimon stranded together.

This is a world of sprawling digital landscapes, powerful factions vying for control, and ancient secrets waiting to be unearthed. From the last human bastion of [[Sectors/Old Sector/Amaterasu/Amaterasu City\|Amaterasu City]] to the frozen fortresses of the North, your story is about to unfold.

Use this hub to navigate the essential lore, rules, and characters of our world. Good luck, and may your connection with your partner be strong!
